        My name is Tim Bedsole and I'm a full-stack web developer living in Florida.
        I love getting my hands dirty with code and building amazing applications from scratch.
        I recently received my full-stack web development certification from UCF, where I not only learned
        web development, but how to work in a team setting and how to really think like a developer.
        Working closely with likeminded individuals amplifies my passion for web development and keeps me engaged.
        I'm always trying to think of ways to do something better, and I live for that lightbulb moment.
